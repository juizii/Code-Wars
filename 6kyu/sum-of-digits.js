// Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

// Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

// Examples
//     16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
//    942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
// 132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
// 493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

function digital_root(n) {
    return (n - 1) % 9 + 1;
  }

  //I had to get help for this one. There's a formula in which to calculate the digital squareroot of n is: "the digital root of a positive integer n is equal to n mod 9 if n mod 9 is not zero. If n mod 9 is zero, then the digital root is 9."
